        <p>"Thanks to all those who support me. I was ready to "evaporate". In the past, the victims will bear the pressure of public opinion from all aspects of society, and I am afraid that I will collapse as a result. But fortunately, after me, more female victims have come forward, and I have also received the concern and support from a lot of people. I never fight alone. Now, even if someone still uses 'slut humiliation' to attack me, I will not be afraid any more. "</font></p>

<div class='story-body'>
    <p class ='body-text'>Experts have pointed out that sexual harassment cases are difficult to file in China as it is hard to obtain evidence. Plantiffs have lost most of the cases in history. Even when the victims won, compensations for such cases are merely 3,000 yuan ($400) on average. </p>
    <p class ='body-text'>All these have prevented victims from publicly defending their rights, as they could risk many things for nothing. The MeToo movement in 2018 was a rare oppotunity for victims to stand together and speak up. But unfortunately, support from the legal system was still missing in most cases. </p>
