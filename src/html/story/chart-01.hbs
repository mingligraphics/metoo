    <p style='color: white' class ='body-text'>#MeToo in China first erupted at the begining of 2018 on social media platforms like weibo and wechat. The first few cases that caught public attention were mostly from colleage campuses, where professors were accused of sexually harrassing or even raping their female students.</p> 
    <p style='color: white' class ='body-text'> Encouraged by the early cases, more and more people broke the silence. The highlight of the movement was in July, when the number of reported preptrators surged 33 in a single month. Meanwhile, the movement spread beyond campuses and brought down many prominent figures across multiple industries.</p>
